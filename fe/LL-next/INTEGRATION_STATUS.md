# Frontend Integration Status

## Phase 1: Backend API Integration ✅ COMPLETED

## Phase 2: FHIR Resource Integration ✅ COMPLETED

### What's Been Done:

1. **Environment Configuration** ✅
   - Created `.env.example` with all required environment variables
   - Includes backend URLs, blockchain config, and authentication settings

2. **Triage API Route Updated** ✅
   - `/app/api/triage/submit/route.ts` now calls Azure Functions backend
   - Handles both streaming and JSON responses
   - Proper error handling and API key authentication

3. **Triage UI Updated** ✅
   - Removed local AI SDK calls
   - Now uses backend API through `/api/triage/submit`
   - Displays thread ID for conversation continuity
   - Shows FHIR resources returned from backend
   - Added error alerts and loading states
   - Auto-scroll to latest messages

### How to Test:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Start the Azure Functions backend:
   ```bash
   cd ../../az/llmazfunc
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/triage

5. Start a conversation about symptoms

### Expected Behavior:
- Messages are sent to Azure Functions backend
- Backend processes with OpenAI Assistant
- Response streams back to UI
- FHIR resources are displayed when generated
- Thread ID maintains conversation context

## Phase 2: FHIR Resource Integration ✅ COMPLETED

### What's Been Done:

1. **Extended FHIR Type Definitions** ✅
   - Added complete FHIR R4 types for Observation, RiskAssessment, and Condition
   - Added supporting types: Quantity, Period, Annotation
   - Created AnyFhirResource union type

2. **Created FHIR Display Components** ✅
   - `ObservationCard` - Displays clinical observations with values, dates, and interpretations
   - `RiskAssessmentCard` - Shows risk predictions with probability, severity, and mitigation
   - `ResourceList` - Smart component that renders appropriate card based on resource type
   - Generic fallback for unknown resource types

3. **Created FHIR Service** ✅
   - Full CRUD operations for FHIR resources
   - Patient-specific resource fetching
   - Bundle handling for search results
   - Configurable authentication

4. **Updated Triage UI** ✅
   - Integrated ResourceList component
   - FHIR resources now display with rich formatting
   - Proper type safety with AnyFhirResource

### Features Added:
- ✅ Professional FHIR resource cards with icons and badges
- ✅ Risk level visualization with color coding
- ✅ Probability display with progress bars
- ✅ Automatic resource type detection
- ✅ Expandable details for complex resources
- ✅ FHIR service for future resource fetching

### Component Locations:
- Types: `/lib/types/fhir.ts`
- Components: `/components/fhir/`
- Service: `/lib/services/fhir.ts`

## Phase 3: Smart Contract Integration ✅ COMPLETED

### What's Been Done:

1. **Installed ethers.js** ✅
   - Added ethers.js v6.11.0 for blockchain interaction
   - Full TypeScript support included

2. **Created Blockchain Service** ✅
   - Complete service module at `/lib/services/blockchain.ts`
   - Features:
     - MetaMask wallet connection
     - CRUD operations for records
     - Audit log retrieval with event parsing
     - Data integrity verification
     - Contract status monitoring

3. **Built Blockchain UI Components** ✅
   - `AuditTrail` - Displays complete audit history with transaction details
   - `BlockchainHash` - Shows blockchain hash with verification status
   - `BlockchainStatus` - Wallet connection and contract status card

4. **Updated Admin Settings** ✅
   - Connected blockchain settings to actual smart contract
   - Real-time wallet connection
   - Live contract statistics display
   - Contract pause status indicator

### Features Added:
- ✅ MetaMask wallet integration
- ✅ Real-time blockchain hash verification
- ✅ Complete audit trail with event details
- ✅ Transaction links and block numbers
- ✅ Data integrity verification
- ✅ Contract status monitoring
- ✅ Admin blockchain configuration

### Component Locations:
- Service: `/lib/services/blockchain.ts`
- Components: `/components/blockchain/`
- Admin Integration: `/components/admin/system-settings.tsx`

### Environment Variables Added:
```bash
# Blockchain
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
NEXT_PUBLIC_LELINK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<from deployment>
```

### Next Steps:
- Phase 4: Authentication Alignment
