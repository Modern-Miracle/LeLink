My nausea is mild, I haven't vomited but I feel a little queasy. No changes in bowel movements, everything seems normal there. I just finished my period last week and I'm not pregnant. I haven't noticed any changes in my appetite or weight, and no urinary symptoms.",
      "received": {
        "reply": "Thank you for providing that detailed information. Based on your symptoms, I will assess the risk level.\n\n1. **Pain Characteristics**: Sharp, intermittent pain in the lower right abdomen.\n2. **Duration**: Symptoms have been present since yesterday.\n3. **Nausea**: Mild, with no vomiting.\n4. **Bowel Movements**: Normal.\n5. **Menstrual History**: Recently finished your period, and no possibility of pregnancy.\n6. **Other Symptoms**: No changes in appetite, weight, or urinary symptoms.\n\nGiven the sharp pain in the lower right abdomen, it is important to consider potential conditions such as appendicitis or ovarian issues, especially since you are experiencing nausea. However, the absence of fever and other severe symptoms may indicate a lower risk.\n\nI will proceed with the following risk assessment:\n- **Risk Level**: Medium (due to the sharp pain and nausea, but no severe symptoms).\n- **Rationale**: Sharp lower right abdominal pain with mild nausea warrants further evaluation, but the absence of fever and other alarming symptoms reduces the immediate risk.\n\nNow, I will generate the necessary FHIR resources. Before we conclude, is there anything else you'd like to add?",
