Let’s start by asking some important questions to assess your condition:\n\n1. **Duration**: When did your headache start?\n2. **Pain Character**: On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your headache pain? (1 being mild and 10 being the worst pain imaginable)\n3. **Associated Symptoms**: Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache, such as vision changes (like blurred or double vision), difficulty speaking, weakness, or changes in sensation?\n4. **Triggers**: Have you noticed any specific triggers that seem to cause or worsen your headache, such as stress, certain foods, lack of sleep, or dehydration?\n5. **Medical History**: Do you have any history of migraines or headaches? Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?\n6. **Treatment**: Have you taken any medications or remedies for the headache, and if so, did they help?\n\nYour responses will help us assess your risk level.",

To summarize again:\n\n- You have used over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen in the past, which have provided some relief for your migraines.\n- Your hydration level seems normal.\n- You have been experiencing some stress due to work but have not had major sleep disturbances or dietary changes.\n\nI will now evaluate your risk based on the symptoms and history provided. Given that you have a severe headache with a history of migraines, mild nausea, and sensitivity to light, it's essential to consider a possible migraine attack. As you haven't reported any alarming symptoms such as vision changes or neurological deficits, we need to assess the situation carefully.\n\nBefore we conclude, I want to ensure I’ve captured everything accurately. I've collected information about your severe throbbing headache, nausea, light sensitivity, history of migraines, use of over-the-counter pain relievers, normal hydration, and recent stress.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to add?",
