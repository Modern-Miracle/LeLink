The pain being moderate (5/10) and given the mild nausea without fever does provide some context, but it's important for me to gather a bit more information before determining the urgency.\n\n1. Is the pain constant or does it come and go?\n2. Have you had any similar pain in the past?\n3. Is there anything that makes the pain better or worse, such as movement, eating, or specific positions?\n4. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as vomiting, changes in bowel movements, or urinary issues?\n\nThe answers to these questions will help me understand the situation better and advise you on whether an immediate hospital visit is necessary.",

Based on what you’ve described:\n\n- Constant lower right abdominal pain (rating 5/10)\n- Mild nausea without vomiting\n- Normal bowel movements\n- No urinary issues\n- Pain worsens with movement or bending over\n\nWhile your symptoms do not indicate an immediate life-threatening emergency, the fact that you have constant pain and it worsens with movement could suggest a condition that may require further evaluation, such as appendicitis or another abdominal issue.\n\nI recommend seeking medical attention for a more thorough evaluation as soon as possible. It’s important to have a healthcare provider examine you to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\nI've gathered the following key points:\n- Age: 35-year-old female\n- Symptoms: Constant lower right abdominal pain, mild nausea, normal bowel movements, no urinary issues\n- Pain scale: 5/10\n- Pain worsens with movement or bending over\n\nBefore we conclude, is there anything else you'd like to add?",
