Can you describe the nature of your abdominal pain? For example, is it sharp, dull, cramping, or constant?\n2. When did the pain start, and has it changed in intensity since then?\n3. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation?\n4. Have you noticed any unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge?\n5. Do you have any history of similar pain or any diagnosed conditions in your abdomen?\n6. Have you taken any medications or treatments for this pain?\n\nThese questions will help in making an accurate assessment.",

Before I continue with additional questions, I want to check for any red flags.\n\n1. Have you experienced any vomiting or severe nausea that prevents you from keeping fluids down?\n2. Is there any pain when you urinate, or have you noticed any changes in urination (such as increased frequency or urgency)?\n3. Do you have any history of ovarian cysts, appendicitis, or other abdominal surgeries?\n4. Have you experienced any sudden or severe symptoms, such as faintness or dizziness?\n\nThese questions will help to gauge the risk associated with your symptoms.",
