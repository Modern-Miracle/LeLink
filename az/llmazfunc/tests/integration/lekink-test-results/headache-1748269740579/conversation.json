Given the severity of your headache (7/10), the throbbing nature, sensitivity to light, and mild nausea, it's important to consider the possibility of a migraine or other serious conditions.\n\nHowever, I need to check for any red flag symptoms that could indicate a more serious issue. \n\n1. Have you experienced any sudden onset of severe headache (like a \"thunderclap\" headache)?\n2. Are you experiencing any confusion, loss of consciousness, or any neurological symptoms (like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking)?\n\nPlease let me know so I can better assess your situation.",

      "received": {
        "reply": "Thank you for clarifying that. Since your headache has gradually worsened over the last few hours and you are not experiencing any alarming symptoms like sudden severe headache or neurological issues, it seems less likely to be an emergency situation. However, the severity of your headache and associated symptoms still warrant medical attention.\n\nBased on the information you've provided, I would assess your risk level as medium. This means you should seek medical evaluation, but it may not require immediate emergency care.\n\nBefore we conclude, is there anything else you'd like to add?",
