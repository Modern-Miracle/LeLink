When did the headache start, and how long has it been occurring?\n2. Can you rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the worst pain imaginable?\n3. Have you experienced similar headaches in the past?\n4. Have you had any recent changes in your vision, such as blurred vision or seeing flashes of light?\n5. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as a stiff neck, fever, or changes in consciousness?\n6. Have you taken any medication for the headache, and if so, what did you take and did it help?",

Did anything trigger this headache, such as stress, lack of sleep, or specific foods?\n2. Are there any factors that seem to alleviate the pain, such as rest or being in a dark room?\n3. Have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or significant changes in your routine?\n\nThese details can help in understanding the situation better before I assess the risk level.",

You have a history of migraines and have noticed that stress and poor sleep may have triggered this episode. You also mentioned sensitivity to light and mild nausea, but no changes in vision or other significant symptoms.\n\nBased on this information, I'm going to assess your risk level.\n\nI've collected information about your symptoms: a throbbing right-sided headache with intensity of 7/10, history of migraines, potential triggers of stress and lack of sleep, accompanied by light sensitivity and mild nausea. Before we conclude, is there anything else you'd like to add?",
