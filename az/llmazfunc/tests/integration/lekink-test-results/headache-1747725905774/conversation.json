Can you please describe the severity of your headache on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the worst pain you've ever experienced?\n2. When did the headache begin, and how long has it lasted?\n3. Have you experienced any visual changes, such as blurred vision or flashing lights?\n4. Do you have any other symptoms, such as difficulty speaking, weakness in one arm or leg, or fever?\n5. Have you had any recent head injuries or trauma?\n6. Do you have any relevant medical history, such as migraines or other chronic headache conditions?\n7. Are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs?\n\nYour responses will help me evaluate your risk level.",

Here are the key points:\n\n- The risk level is assessed as **high** due to your symptoms of a severe unilateral throbbing headache, with sensitivity to light and mild nausea, alongside your history of migraines.\n\n- Two FHIR-compliant resources have been created to document your risk assessment and findings from our conversation.\n\nI recommend managing your symptoms with hydration, rest, and potentially over-the-counter analgesics, if appropriate. Please consider contacting a healthcare professional for further evaluation and advice on managing your headache.\n\nThank you for your time, and I hope you find relief soon.
