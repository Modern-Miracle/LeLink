        "reply": "Thank you for sharing that information. To better assess your situation, Iâ€™ll need to ask a few more questions.\n\n1. Is the cut deep, or does it appear shallow?\n2. Are you experiencing any pain in the area of the cut? If so, how would you rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10?\n3. Have you noticed any signs of infection, such as redness, warmth, swelling, or pus around the cut?\n4. Are you up to date with your tetanus vaccinations, and was the knife you used clean?\n5. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as dizziness or fainting?\n\nYour feedback will help me assess the risk level accordingly.",
