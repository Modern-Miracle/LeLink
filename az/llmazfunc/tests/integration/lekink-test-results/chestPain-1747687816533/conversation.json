It's important that we assess this situation carefully, as chest pain, especially with shortness of breath and sweating, can be a sign of a serious condition.\n\n### I need to ask you some important questions to understand your symptoms better:\n\n1. **Onset**: When did you first notice the chest pain and shortness of breath? Did it start suddenly or gradually?\n\n2. **Duration**: How long have the symptoms been present? \n\n3. **Pain Characteristics**: Can you describe the chest pain further? For example, is it sharp, dull, or pressure-like? Does it radiate to any other areas (like your arm, jaw, or back)?\n\n4. **Associated Symptoms**: Are you experiencing any other symptoms like nausea, lightheadedness, or palpitations?\n\n5. **Medical History**: Do you have any known medical conditions, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of smoking?\n\n6. **Medications**: Are you currently taking any medications?\n\n7. **Family History**: Is there a family history of heart disease or other cardiovascular conditions?\n\nPlease answer these questions so we can evaluate your situation accurately.",

I have a history of hypertension and high cholesterol, and I take Atorvastatin and Lisinopril for those. As for my family, my father had a heart attack when he was in his 50s.",
