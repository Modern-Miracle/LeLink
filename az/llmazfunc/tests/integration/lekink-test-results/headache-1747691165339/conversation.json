To summarize:\n\n- You are a 28-year-old female with a throbbing headache on the right side.\n- The headache has been present for about 3 hours, building up gradually.\n- You rate the pain as a 7 out of 10.\n- You have a history of migraines, but no associated symptoms like vision changes, dizziness, or weakness.\n- You are not currently taking any medications and have not experienced head trauma, fever, or a stiff neck.\n\nNext, I'd like to gather just a bit more information:\n\n1. **Photophobia**: You mentioned sensitivity to light—how severe is this? Does it occur even with regular light?\n2. **Nausea**: You mentioned mild nausea. Is it constant, or does it come and go?\n3. **Triggers**: Have you identified any potential triggers for this headache, such as stress, lack of sleep, certain foods, or dehydration?\n\nThese additional details will help in assessing your risk level and determining the next steps.",

As for triggers, I've been quite stressed lately due to work, so maybe that could be a trigger. I've also not been hydrating enough. I haven't noticed any specific foods triggering my migraines though.",
      "received": {
        "reply": "Thank you for the additional information. Here's a brief summary of what we have:\n\n- The sensitivity to light is quite severe, prompting you to seek a dark room.\n- Your nausea comes and goes but is present.\n- You’ve been experiencing increased stress due to work and have not been hydrating enough, which could be potential triggers.\n\nNow, I'll assess your risk level based on these findings. Since you have a history of migraines, significant light sensitivity, and nausea, it suggests that you may be experiencing a migraine attack rather than a different type of headache.\n\nI have gathered all the necessary information. Before we conclude, is there anything else you'd like to add?",

I have documented your assessment, and you're currently at high risk for a migraine attack based on your symptoms and triggers. \n\nIt's important to find relief, so I recommend considering the following options:\n- Stay in the dark room to minimize light exposure.\n- Hydrate properly to relieve potential dehydration.\n- Over-the-counter pain medication, if you're able and it’s safe for you to take.\n- Relaxation techniques or stress management strategies.\n\nIf your symptoms worsen or do not improve, please seek medical attention. \n\nThank you for sharing your information.
