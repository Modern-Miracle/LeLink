Let's gather some more information to assess your situation properly.\n\n1. **Headache Details**: \n   - How long have you been experiencing the headache?\n   - On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is the pain?\n   - Have you had similar headaches in the past?\n\n2. **Nausea**: \n   - Is the nausea constant, or does it come and go?\n   - Have you vomited or felt like you might vomit?\n\n3. **Light Sensitivity**: \n   - Is the sensitivity to light affecting your ability to do daily activities?\n   - Are there any other symptoms accompanying the light sensitivity, such as blurred vision or visual disturbances?\n\n4. **Red Flag Symptoms**: \n   - Have you experienced any sudden changes in vision, weakness, confusion, or difficulty speaking?\n   - Do you have a history of migraines or any other medical conditions?\n\nYour responses will help me assess your risk level and provide appropriate guidance.",

      "sent": "The headache started about 3 hours ago and it's really intense, I'd say a 7 out of 10. I've had similar headaches before, my doctor said they were migraines. \n\nThe nausea isn't constant, but it seems to get worse when the headache does. I haven't actually vomited, just feel like I might. \n\nThe light sensitivity is making it hard to do anything. I've been in a dark room most of the day. I haven't noticed any blurred vision or visual disturbances though. \n\nAs for red flag symptoms, I haven't experienced any sudden changes in vision, weakness, confusion, or difficulty speaking. I do have a history of migraines, but no other medical conditions.",

        "reply": "Thank you for providing that information. Based on your symptoms and history, it appears that you are experiencing a migraine attack. Here’s a summary of your symptoms:\n\n- **Throbbing headache** on the right side, rated 7/10 in intensity.\n- **Sensitivity to light**, making it difficult to engage in daily activities.\n- **Mild nausea** that worsens with the headache but no vomiting.\n- A history of similar headaches diagnosed as migraines.\n- No red flag symptoms such as sudden changes in vision, weakness, confusion, or difficulty speaking.\n\nGiven the intensity of your headache and the associated symptoms, I would assess your risk level as **medium**. This indicates that you should seek medical attention, but it is not an emergency situation.\n\nBefore we conclude, is there anything else you'd like to add?",
