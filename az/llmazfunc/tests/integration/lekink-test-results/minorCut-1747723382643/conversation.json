Are you experiencing any pain, swelling, or signs of infection (such as redness or warmth around the wound)?\n5. Have you had any tetanus vaccinations in the last 5 years?\n   \nPlease respond with whatever details you can provide.",

No, I haven't cleaned it yet, I just wrapped it with a paper towel.\n4. There's a bit of pain, it's like a 2 out of 10. No swelling or any signs of infection so far.\n5. About the tetanus shot, I think I had one when I was a kid but not in the last 5 years.",
