# 📖 LeLink Project Overview

> **🇪🇺 EU Funded Project**: LeLink is supported by the [NGI Sargasso](https://ngisargasso.eu/) programme under the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, fostering innovation in decentralized healthcare technologies through transatlantic collaboration.

> **🏛️ Organizations**: Developed by [Hora e.V.](https://hora-ev.eu) in collaboration with [Modern Miracle](https://modern-miracle.com), focusing on crisis healthcare solutions.

## 🎯 What is LeLink?

LeLink is a **blockchain-based crisis healthcare audit system** specifically designed for **people in vulnerable situations**. It provides secure, transparent, and immutable logging of medical data access during emergencies and crisis scenarios. Think of it as a "digital trust ledger" that tracks healthcare interactions while protecting patient privacy - no actual medical data is ever stored on the blockchain.

## 🆘 The Crisis Healthcare Challenge

### Current Problems

During crisis situations, healthcare providers face unique challenges when treating vulnerable populations:

1. **📋 Trust Building**: Vulnerable populations need transparency about data usage
2. **🔒 Privacy Protection**: Crisis situations require enhanced data protection
3. **🤝 Multi-Agency Coordination**: Emergency response involves multiple organizations
4. **📊 Regulatory Compliance**: HIPAA, GDPR compliance during emergency situations
5. **🔍 Transparency**: Patients in crisis need assurance their data is protected
6. **⚡ Rapid Response**: Time-critical situations need immediate, verifiable data access

### How LeLink Addresses Crisis Healthcare Needs

LeLink uses blockchain technology to create an **immutable, transparent, and decentralized** audit trail specifically for crisis healthcare scenarios:

- ✅ **Crisis Transparency**: Every medical interaction is permanently recorded for vulnerable populations
- ✅ **Resilient Infrastructure**: No single point of failure during emergencies
- ✅ **Real-time Trust Building**: Instant visibility builds confidence with crisis patients
- ✅ **Emergency Compliance**: Maintains HIPAA/GDPR compliance even in crisis situations
- ✅ **Vulnerable Population Protection**: Enhanced privacy safeguards for at-risk individuals
- ✅ **Multi-Agency Coordination**: Secure audit trails for emergency response teams

## 🔧 How LeLink Works

### The Simple Explanation

Imagine LeLink as a **digital logbook** that everyone can read but no one can erase or fake:

1. **📝 Record Creation**: When healthcare data is created, a "fingerprint" (hash) is logged
2. **👀 Access Logging**: Every time someone views the data, it's recorded
3. **🔄 Update Tracking**: Data modifications are logged with new fingerprints
4. **🤝 Sharing Events**: When data is shared between organizations, it's documented
5. **❌ Revocation Logs**: When access is removed, it's permanently recorded

### The Technical Explanation

LeLink is a **smart contract** deployed on blockchain networks that:

1. **Stores Metadata Only**: Only data hashes and access logs, never actual healthcare data
2. **Uses Cryptographic Hashes**: SHA-256 hashes ensure data integrity without exposure
3. **Implements Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for different user types
4. **Emits Immutable Events**: All actions trigger blockchain events that can't be altered
5. **Provides Gas Optimization**: Efficient design minimizes transaction costs

### Integrated Data Flow

1. **Healthcare Application** (Azure Functions) processes patient triage requests
2. **FHIR Resources** are generated (RiskAssessment, Observation) and stored in:
   - Development: Azurite blob storage
   - Production: Azure FHIR Service
3. **Data Fingerprints** (SHA-256 hashes) are stored in the LeLink contract
4. **Access Events** are permanently logged on the blockchain
5. **Applications** can verify data integrity by comparing stored hashes
